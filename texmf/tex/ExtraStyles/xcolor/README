Package `xcolor' by Dr. Uwe Kern
(xcolor at ukern dot de)

v2.00 (2004/07/04)

`xcolor' provides easy driver-independent access to several kinds of
colors, tints, shades, tones, and mixes of arbitrary colors by means of
color expressions like \color{red!50!green!20!blue}.
It allows to select a document-wide target color model and offers tools
for automatic color schemes, conversion between nine color models,
alternating table row colors, color blending and masking, and color
separation.

Installation instructions
=========================

Extract all package files:
  `latex xcolor.ins'

Create the documentation:
  `latex xcolor.dtx'
  `latex xcolor.dtx'
  `makeindex -s gind.ist xcolor.idx'
  `latex xcolor.dtx'
  `latex xcolor.dtx'

Run the test files (N=1,2,...):
  `latex xcolorN.tex'
  `latex xcolorN.tex'

Notes
=====

- `xcolor1.tex' should run with both LaTeX and pdfLaTeX, it yields a
  50-page document with several systematic color conversion examples
- `xcolor2.tex' is a 2-page `pstricks' example document that won't run
  with pdfLaTeX
- `xcolor3.tex' is a 1-page example for demonstrating the logging
  facilities
- If the file `xcolor.ins' is missing, run `latex xcolor.dtx' once
  and quit the LaTeX compiler as soon as the first error message
  appears.
