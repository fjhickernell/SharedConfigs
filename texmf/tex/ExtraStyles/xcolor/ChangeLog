History
=======

2004/07/04 v2.00
* New features:
    - extended functionality for color expressions: mix colors like a
      painter;
    - support for color blending: specify color mix expressions that
      are being blended with every displayed color;
    - \xglobal command for selective control of globality for color
      definitions, blends, and masks;
    - multiple step operations (e.g. \color{foo!!+++}) and access to
      individual members (e.g. \color{foo!![7]}) in color series;
    - \providecolor command to define only non-existent colors;
    - \definecolorset and \providecolorset commands to facilitate the
      construction of color sets with common underlying color model;
    - additional 147 predefined color names according to SVG 1.1
      specification;
    - `xpdfborder' key for setting the width of hyperlink borders in a
      more driver-independent way if `dvips' is used.
* Changes:
    - `color' package now completely integrated within `xcolor';
    - `override', `usenames', `nodvipsnames' options and \xdefinecolor
      command no longer needed;
    - `dvips' and `dvipsnames' options now independent of each other;
    - \tracingcolors's behaviour changed to make it more versatile and
      reduce log file size in standard cases;
    - \rdivide's syntax made more flexible (divide by numbers and/or
      dimensions);
    - code restructured, some internal commands renamed;
    - documentation rearranged and enhanced.
* Bugfixes:
    - \definecolor{foo}{named}{bar} did not work (error introduced in
      v1.11);
    - more robust behaviour of conditionals within `pstricks'
      key-values.

2004/05/09 v1.11
* New features:
    - switch \ifglobalcolors to control whether color definitions are
      global or local;
    - option `hyperref' provides color expression support for the
      border colors of hyperlinks, e.g.
      \hypersetup{xurlbordercolor=red!50!yellow};
    - internal hooks \XC@bcolor, \XC@mcolor, and \XC@ecolor for
      additional code that has to be executed immediately before/after
      the current color is being displayed.
* Changes:
    - \XC@logcolor renamed to \XC@display, which is now the core color
      display command;
    - improved interface to `pstricks'.

2004/03/27 v1.10
* New features:
    - support for `named' model;
    - support for `dvips' colors
      (may now be used within color expressions);
    - internal representation of `ordinary' and `named' colors merged
      into unified data structure;
    - allow multiple `-' signs at the beginning of color expressions.
* Bugfixes:
    - commands like \color[named]{foo} caused errors when color masking
      or target model conversion were active;
    - incompatibility with `soul' package: commands \hl, \ul, etc.
      could yield unexpected results.
* Documentation:
    - added formula for general color expressions;
    - enhanced text and index;
    - removed dependence of index generation on local configuration
      file.

2004/02/16 v1.09
* New features:
    - color model `HTML', a 24-bit hexadecimal `RGB' variant;
      allows to specify colors like \color[HTML]{AFFE90};
    - color names `orange', `violet', `purple', and `brown' added to
      the set of predefined colors.
* New xcolor homepage: www.ukern.de/tex/xcolor.html
* Bugfix: \xdefinecolor sometimes did not normalise its parameters.
* Changes:
    - slight improvements of the documentation;
    - example file xcolor1.tex reorganised and abridged.

2004/02/04 v1.08
* New commands/features:
    - \selectcolormodel to change the target model within a document;
    - \adjustUCRBG to fine-tune undercolor-removal and
      black-generation during conversion to `cmyk'.
* Bugfix: color expressions did not work correctly in connection with
  active `!' character, e.g. in case of \usepackage[frenchb]{babel}.
* Code re-organisation:
    - \XC@xdefinecolor merged into \xdefinecolor, making the first
      command obsolete;
    - several internal commands improved/streamlined.

2004/01/20 v1.07
* New feature: support for color masking and color separation.
* New commands:
    - \rmultiply to multiply a dimension register by a real number;
    - \xcolorcmd to pass commands that are to be executed at the end
      of the package.
* Changes:
    - more consistent color handling: extended colors now always take
      precedence over standard colors;
    - several commands improved by using code from the LaTeX kernel.
* Documentation: some minor changes.
* Example files: additional pstricks examples (file xcolor2.tex).

2003/12/15 v1.06
* New feature: extended color expressions, allowing for cascaded mix
  operations, e.g. \color{red!30!green!40!blue}.
* Documentation: new section on color expressions.
* Bugfix: color series stepping did not work correctly within
  non-displaying commands like \extractcolorspec{foo!!+}
  (this bug was introduced in v1.05).
* Renamed commands: \ukfileversion and similar internal constants
  renamed to \XCfileversion etc.
* Removed commands: \ifXCpst and \ifXCtable made obsolete by a simple
  trick.

2003/11/21 v1.05
* Bugfixes:
    - package option `hideerrors' should now work as expected;
    - usage of `.' in the first color expression in a document caused
      an error due to incorrect initialisation.
* Code re-organisation: \extractcolorspec now uses \XC@splitcolor,
  making \XC@extract obsolete.

2003/11/09 v1.04
* New feature: easy access to current color within color expressions.
* New option: `override' to replace \definecolor by \xdefinecolor.
* New command: \tracingcolors for logging color-specific information.

  as arguments.

2003/09/15 v1.01
* New feature: \definecolorseries and friends.
* Documentation: removed some `doc'-related side-effects.
* Code re-organisation: all calculation-related tools put to one place.
* Bugfixes:
    - \@rdivide: added \relax to fix problem with negative numerators;
    - \rowc@l@rs: replaced \@ifempty by \@ifxempty.

2003/09/09 v1.00
* First published release.
